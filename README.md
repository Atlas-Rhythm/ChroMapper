# This is ChroMapper.
ChroMapper is an in-development, Unity-based map editor for Beat Saber, specializing in modded map creation. ChroMapper also offers various tools and features that tailor towards the advanced mappers of the community.

### Coming from a Tutorial?
Welcome! This is the source code for ChroMapper.

The intention for the asset files being open to the public is to help aid other contributors in making ChroMapper better. ChroMapper will not be anywhere close to where it is today without the help of several contributors taking time out of their lives to expand upon the available source code.

***However, what you see here is in-development software. This is not final. The source code will contain bugs and issues, potentially making it impossible to map with. I currently do not recommend (or endorse) cloning and building ChroMapper outside of development purposes. If you are building ChroMapper with the sole intention to map with it, you will not get support.*** If you would like support for ChroMapper, [please consider joining Closed Beta](https://github.com/Caeden117/ChroMapper#releases).
